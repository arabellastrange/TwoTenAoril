Hey all as agreed upon this is outline for the work you are going to do for stage three
>> set home directory to defualt PATH [done]
>> print PATH [done]
>> change PATH
>> restore PATH

These can be built on the pre-exisiting functions getnv() and setnv()

For now we will use a simple text file to store the edited PATH but should begin to consider a small databases which would hold both PATH and command history
